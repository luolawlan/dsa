# What is Algorithms?
Algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that access one or more value as input and get the output from Algorithm result.

# Why we need to learn Algorithms to solve computional problam?
The important Presupposition that computer resourse are shortage. We can't waste too much computer memory, disk, time during runing code that it is expemsive.
